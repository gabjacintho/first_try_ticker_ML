# First try machine learning model to predict ticker prices

I was alwayes curious to really check how random was the market and if it was possible to predict changes in prices... So I coded this.

This is a really simple model - a multilayer perceptron - and it takes daily close prices from selected ticker and tries to predict if the target ticker price will rise or fall. There's also various loops to quickly train multiple model with different parameters.
